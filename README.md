# Coffee-App

## Description 

A e-commerce and online shopping platform that is developed in Flutter with Dart language. 
This reason for using Flutter as the environment for development in mobile app is that it allows the code to be reusable for both the major platforms in the mobile app dev, without needing to code in separate language to create the same application for different platforms. 

The coffee-app is a personal project that was started off as an experiment in how well Flutter can perform, as compared to using the native environment such as Java to code Android apps, or Swift for Apple apps. As the coffee-app is built experimentally, only users side and Android environment have been developed for the app. 

Please note that this is the first project that I have started in the Flutter environment, so there are likely to be incomplete parts or inefficiency in the code handling, system's architecture and so on.
